# Architecture Documentation

## High-Level Design (HLD)
### Components
- **Frontend**: (Optional) React/Angular application for interacting with the platform.
- **Backend**: A Spring Boot REST API manages requests and integrates with pipelines.
- **ML Pipelines**: Python-based modules handle data ingestion, preprocessing, and model training.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for storing logs, results, and metadata.
- **Infrastructure**: Dockerized services deployed on Kubernetes clusters, provisioned using Terraform.

### Architecture Diagram
Below is a textual representation of the architecture. Render this using a diagramming tool for better visualization:

Low-Level Design (LLD)
Backend
Controller Layer:

Manages API endpoints like /status and /predict.

Provides a unified interface to interact with ML pipelines.

Service Layer:

Encapsulates business logic, e.g., invoking ML models and pipelines.

Communicates with the database for result storage.

Exception Layer:

Handles API errors and translates them into meaningful HTTP responses.

ML Pipelines
Data Ingestion:

Reads data from external sources (e.g., CSV, JSON).

Preprocessing:

Handles cleaning, normalizing, and feature engineering.

Training:

Trains models using frameworks like sklearn or TensorFlow.

Infrastructure
Docker images are created for backend and pipelines.

Kubernetes manages deployment and scaling.

Terraform provisions AWS S3 buckets for model and log storage.

User -> Frontend: Sends request (e.g., Predict)
Frontend -> Backend: API call (e.g., /predict)
Backend -> Pipelines: Invoke ML pipeline
Pipelines -> Database: Fetch preprocessed data (if needed)
Pipelines -> S3: Load trained model
Pipelines --> Backend: Return prediction results
Backend --> Frontend: Return results to user

Visual Notes
Architecture Diagram:

The architecture diagram highlights how components interact: Frontend, Backend, Pipelines, Database, and Infrastructure.

You can create the diagram using tools like Draw.io or Lucidchart. Use boxes for each component and arrows for interactions.

Sequence Diagram:

Shows the flow of requests/responses between actors and system components.

PlantUML allows you to directly generate sequence diagrams from the above syntax.
